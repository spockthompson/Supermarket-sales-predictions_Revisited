# Supermarket sales predictions_Revisited
 
 "## Task\n",
    "- For this assignment, you will revisit your first project to predict supermarket sales. You will apply what you've learned this week to explain how your models made their predictions.\n",
    "### Project 1 Revisited - Part 1: Remaking, Saving, and Explaining Your Models\n",
    "- For this part of the project, you will be producing a new version of your final project notebook using the updated tools in sklearn v1.1. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Create a new notebook called \"Project 1 - Revisited.ipynb\" in your project repo.\n",
    "    - You may either make a copy of your prior notebook that you will modify,\n",
    "or you can start a new blank notebook and copy over the code from your old notebook (as needed).\n",
    "- Remake your X_train and X_test as DataFrames with the feature names extracted from the column transformer instead of combining your preprocessor and model into 1 pipeline.\n",
    "### LinearRegression\n",
    "- Fit and evaluate your LinearRegresion model using your dataframe X_train and X_test data.\n",
    "- Extract and visualize the coefficients that your model determined.\n",
    "  - Select the top 3 most impactful features and interpret their coefficients in plain English.\n",
    "- Save your figure as a .png file inside your repository (you will need this for the final piece of this assignment - Update Your README).\n",
    "### Tree-Based Model\n",
    "- Fit and evaluate your tree-based regression model using your dataframe X_train and X_test data.\n",
    "- Extract and visualize the feature importances that your model determined.\n",
    "  - Identify the top 5 most important features.\n",
    "- Save your figure as a .png file inside your repository  (you will need this for the final piece of this assignment - Update Your README).\n",
